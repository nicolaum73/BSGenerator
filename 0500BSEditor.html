	<h2>5. BSEditor</h2>
	<p>BSEditor is the graphical-user interface to BSGenerator, responsible for
	single question creation. In time, it will be integrated into a single
	BSGenerator interface.</p>
	<p>Its main application window application is composed of four main areas:
	<ul>
	<li>On the left side, the large text editor is the <b>Question Editor</b>,
	where questions in the BSGenerator specific <a>CSV format</a> are loaded
	and edited.
	<li> On the right side, the <b>Question Preview</b> panel is a space
	reserved for previewing how a question will appear to users in Brightspace.
	<li> The <b>Log Display</b> panel (bottom right) displays information concerning
	actions taken when using the application.
	<li> Above the Question Editor and Question Preview sits the <b>Button Toolbar</b>,
	which offers shortcut buttons for most of the application's functions.
	</ul>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:100%; height:auto' src = 'images/bseditor.png'/>
	</p>
	Further to these panels, a set of menus provides access to all the
	functions offered by the application.

	<h3 id = '5.1'>5.1 Question Editor</h3>
	<p>This editor allows you to create, load, edit and save questions in
	CSV format. You can have several files open, which will be organised with tabs.
	The File, Edit and Question menus offer options related to the content of the
	currently selected tab.</p>

	<h3 id = '5.2'>5.2 Question Preview</h3>
	<p>This area displays a preview of the question being edited, when that
	function is activated (either through the menu Question / Preview, or
	with the Preview button). This is a realistic approximation of the question
	appearance in Brightspace. If more than one question variation is generated,
	you can use the navigation buttons to switch between different variations.</p>
	<p>It also shows which are the correct answers, the question feedback, and
	the score the current answer will achieve. This is a dynamic display; try out
	different question answers, and the score will automatically adjust.</p>

	<h3 id = '5.3'>5.3 Log Display</h3>
	<p>This area keeps track of most operations, along with the date and time at
	which these were activated (the data is purely local). It is helpful when
	compiling questions, to keep track of potential problems. It can be exported
	into a text file, and its contents can be cleared at any time. These
	functionalities are available through the Tools menu, or with the corresponding
	shortcut buttons.</p>

	<h3 id = '5.4'>5.4 Button Toolbar</h3>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:100%;' src = 'images/button_toolbar.png'/>
	</p>
	The Button Toolbar provides shortcuts for all major functionalities. These
	buttons implement the following functions (from left to right):
	<ul>
	<li>create a <b>New</b> (blank) question;
	<li><b>Open</b> an existing question;
	<li><b>Save</b> the current question;
	<li><b>Save a Copy</b> of the current question;
	<li><b>Import</b> a question from a QTI archive;
	<li><b>Export</b> a question into a QTI archive;
	<li><b>Undo</b> the last edit;
	<li><b>Redo</b> a previously undone edit;
	<li><b>Cut</b> text;
	<li><b>Copy</b> text;
	<li><b>Paste</b> text;
	<li>choose the <b>Number of question variations</b> to generate;
	<li><b>Preview</b> the question(s);
	<li>display the generated <b>XML Code</b>;
	<li>display the generated <b>CSV Code</b>;
	<li>display the used <b>Python variables</b>;
	<li><b>Export the Log</b> from the Log Display;
	<li><b>Clear the Log</b> from the Log Display;
	<li>edit the application's <b>Preferences</b>;
	<li>open the <b>Help</b> window;
	<li><b>Quit</b> the application.
	</ul>
