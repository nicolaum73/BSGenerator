	<h3>8.3 Creating Equations</h3>
	Brightspace can easily convert latex equations into MathML for display, and
	BSGenerator provides the same funcionality. The following CSV file illustrates
	several ways in which equations can be incorporated into a question:
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/mat_4_Latex_Equations.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>To create inline equations (i.e. equations that typically have text around them,
	but also simple equations), place the corresponding latex equation code
	between "\\(" and "\\)" tokens. If creating full equations (i.e. equations that
	are typically centered on their own in a line of text, usually complex equations),
	place the latex equation code between "\\[" and \\]" tokens, or between
	"$$" tokens.<br/>
	Note any backslash must be "escaped" with another backslash, hence using "\\[" and
	"\\]" as tokens. This also applies to equation code, such as "\\sqrt". Finally, if
	your latex equation code is inside a Python string, use raw strings to ensure that
	backslashes are not interpreted as Python string escaping characters.
	The following CSV definition gives an example:

	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
	<p><textarea readonly rows = 10 style = 'width:75%;'>
%%import random%%
%%x = random.randint(-5, 5)%%
%%eq = r"\\(\\sqrt{" + str(x) + r"}\\)"%%
questiontype,tf
text,Is %%eq%% a real value?
true,%%100 if x &gt;= 0 else 0%%
false,%%100 if x &lt; 0 else 0%%</textarea></p>
	</div>

	<p style = 'text-decoration: underline;'>latex2mathml</p>

	<p>BSGenerator versions prior to v1.1 suggested the use of this Python library
	for generation of equations. While it technically will still work, its use is
	discouraged from v1.1 onwards.</p>
