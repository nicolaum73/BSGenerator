	<h3>7.8 Matching Questions (MAT)</h3>
	<p>Matching questions ask the student to match one or more questions with one
	of a set of given answers. They require a few CSV definitions:
	the possible answers (items appearing in drop-down boxes), the
	questions (phrases for which a drop-down box item must be selected by the
	student), and the definition of the correct question/answer associations.</p>

	<p>The following is a simple example of a CSV file containing the definition
	of a Matching question:</p>
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/mat_2_Complete.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>The fields that can be specified are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<th>Field</th><th>Mandatory</th><th>Description</th>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>questiontype</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>Must be the first specified field. It states the type of the question.
			"MAT", "Matching" or "Matching Question" are all accepted.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>title</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The title of the question.
			Defaults to "questiontitle".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>weighting</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The score of the question, between 0 and 9999. Defaults to 1.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>difficulty</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The difficulty of the question (1-5).
			Defaults to 1.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>isbonus</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>If this is a bonus question (yes) or not (no). Default no "no".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>ismandatory</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>If this is a mandatory question (yes) or not (no). Default no "yes".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>text</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>The text of the question. Must be contained within
			double quotes, if extending more than one line, or if containing commas.
			Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>image</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Insert an image at the start of the question.
			Specifies a single field, which is the image location.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>answer</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>A possible answer to include in drop-down boxes;
			at least one must be defined. It has two fields: the text that will appear
			in the drop-down box, and an optional label to identify this answer
			(defaults to 1), which can be used with the "question" field below.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>question</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>Used to define a question to ask the student; at least one must
			be defined. It requires two fields: the question text that will be
			presented to the student, and the label of the correct choice, as
			defined with an "answer" definition.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>score</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>The scoring approach to use. A single field is
			expected, with one of the following specifications:
			<ul>
				<li>"equal": the total points for the question are
				equally distributed among each of the questions asked;</li>
				<li>"all": all-or-nothing, i.e. the student must answer all
				the questions correctly to receive the overall points assigned to
				this question;</li>
				<li>right-minus-wrong: same as "equal", but
				with negative scoring; zero is the minimum score (e.g.if there
				were four matching options, and one was correct and three
				incorrect, the total score would be 0 points).</li>
			</ul></td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>hint</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>A hint shown to the students when answering the
			question in a quiz. Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>feedback</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Feedback to show to the students, when
			visualising their test and answers after taking the test (it is
			not shown during test taking). Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>keyword</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Defines a keyword. Can have an optional second
			field with a value. These are not uploaded to Brightspace.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>keywords</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Same as before, but several keywords can be
			defined. No value will be associated with each keyword.</td>
