	<h2>6. BSEditor Main Functions</h2>

	<h3 id = '6.1'>6.1 Creating Questions</h3>
	<p>The main functionality of BSEditor is to create Brightspace quiz
	questions. These are created using the <a href = '0700BSGeneratorCSVformat.html'>extended
	CSV format</a>. You can either create new questions, or open one of the provided
	question templates (from File / New from Template).</p>

	<h3 id = '6.2'>6.2 Opening Questions</h3>
	<p>You can open existing questions written using the BSGenerator
	<a href = '0700BSGeneratorCSVformat.html'>extended CSV format</a>. Please note
	that questions written using the Brightspace import CSV format will not work in
	BSGenerator. If instead you want to open QTI questions, see below how to
	<a href = '0600BSEditorMainFunctions.html#6.3'>import QTI questions</a>.</p>

	<h3 id = '6.3'>6.3 Importing Questions</h3>
	<p>Questions created in Brightspace and exported as QTI packages can be imported
	into BSGenerator. To export a question (or a set of questions) in Brightspace, go to
	"Module Tools" / "Module Admin", then choose "Import / Export / Copy Components":</p>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:50%;' src = 'images/bs_export1.png'/>
	</p>
	Choose "Export as Brightspace Package":
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:50%;' src = 'images/bs_export2.png'/>
	</p>
	<p>Then select what you would like to export from the Question Library
	("Export all items" or "Select individual items to export"); select "Include
	module files in the export package" if the questions have images/files; and
	finally press "Export" After a short period of time, Brightspace will provide
	you with a link to download the QTI package.</p>
	<p>To import a question contained in a Brightspace QTI package onto BSEditor,
	choose File / QTI Import (or the corresponding shortcut button).
	After choosing the file, you will be presented with the QTI Import dialog:
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%; height:auto' src = 'images/qti_import.png'/>
	</p>
	<p>Here you can choose an existing question inside the QTI package, and
	import it as a BSGenerator-compliant CSV file, along with any
	images/attachments that the question may have.</p>

	<h3 id = '6.4'>6.4 Exporting QTI Packages</h3>
	<p>Once a question is ready for deployment, you can export it, i.e. create a QTI
	Package that contains the question. You must preview the question first, as this
	ensures that the specification is correct, and also enables you to see the exact
	question(s) that will be uploaded to Brightspace.<br/>
 	To export the question, choose the menu option "File" / "QTI Export", or use its
	shortcut button. This will bring up the QTI Export dialog, shown below.</p>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:50%;' src = 'images/qti.png'/>
	</p>
	<p>If you just want to export a single question, uncheck all options, press Export,
	and choose where to save the resulting QTI package.
	Any exporting errors will be shown in the Log Display.<br/>
	You can also specify the following parameters:
	<ul>
		<li><b>Question Section</b>:<br/>
		You may choose for the exported question(s) to reside inside a section,
		which will be created when you upload the package to Brightspace; the
		question (or question variations) will reside in that top-level section.
		Note that if a section with that name already exists, a new section with the
		same name will be created (i.e. this option cannot be used to place questions
		inside existing sections in Brightspace).
		You can set the following Section settings (all of these can later be changed
		inside Brightspace):<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Use question title as section name, i.e. set the name of the
			section to be the same as the question title, as specified in the
			CSV file.</li>
			<li>Hide section title from learners.</li>
			<li>Shuffle section contents.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>Title</b>:<br/>
		If you are exporting more than one run of the question (set through the
		spin box in the button bar), then the following option may be of use:
		<ul>
			<li>Add counter suffix to variation(s) title: add a counter
			suffix (e.g. 001, 002, etc) to the title of each question included in
			the QTI package, to uniquely identify these afterwards.</li>
		</ul></li>
		<li><b>Attachments</b>:<br/>
		If you want to upload images and/or attachments to Brightspace, you
		need to be careful. If you upload a QTI package containing a file named
		"plot.png" and that file already exists in Brightspace,
		<u>the new file will overwrite the existing one in Brightspace</u>.
		This can have the undesired effect of changing questions that already
		exist in Brightspace. To mitigate this, a few options are provided:
		<ul>
			<li>Create a sub-folder for attachments. You can choose to create a
			sub-folder that will include all your question images, attachments,
			etc. This folder will be created in Brightspace's file section, and
			your question(s) will link to files inside that folder.</li>
			<li>Mirror section folders. You can give the attachment
			folder the same name as the question title, but note that some
			characters are not allowed (space, quotes, asterisk, slash, backslash, etc).</li>
			<li>Use unique names for images and files. If the attachment
			folder specified already exists in Brightspace, all attached files will
			overwrite existing files with the same name in Brightspace. To
			avoid this, images and attachments can be given unique names (e.g.
			an image called "plot.png" can be renamed to something like
			"<span id = 'rnd_name'></span>_plot.png", when uploaded to Brightspace).</li>
		</ul></li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<h3 id = '6.5'>6.5 Previewing Questions</h3>
	<p>When editing questions, it is useful to preview how they will look in
	Brightspace. BSEditor provides this functionality.
	This doubles up as a "compilation attempt" i.e. checking if the CSV
	specifications will create a valid question (or set of questions).</p>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%; height:auto' src = 'images/qpreview.png'/>
	</p>
	<p>Some extra information (not shown to students) is also displayed:
	<ul>
		<li>The <b>Total Score</b> of the current answer: this is a dynamic display, and will
		be updated when the answer changes (very useful to try answers when developing a question);</li>
		<li>The <b>Correct answer(s)</b>;</li>
		<li>The <b>Question Feedback</b> (potentially shown to students at the end of the quiz);</li>
		<li>The <b>Item Feedback</b> (depending on the question type; shown as above).</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<p>When developing questions containing Python code, you can run the code several
	times, to generate different <a>question variations</a>.
	You can choose the number of times to compile a question variation using the
	selector in the <a href = '0500BSEditor.html#5.4'>Button Toolbar</a>. The
	navigation buttons in the top-right corner of the
	<a href = '0500BSEditor.html#5.2'>Question Preview</a> pane will then allow you
	to preview each question variation.</p>

	<h3 id = '6.6'>6.6 Inspecting XML Code</h3>
	<p>The application provides a means to inspect the resulting question database,
	which will be incorporated into the QTI package. The XML preview window
	allows the user to inspect the generated XML code, prior to exporting.</p>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%;' src = 'images/xml.png'/>
	</p>

	<h3 id = '6.7'>6.7 Inspecting CSV Code</h3>
	<p>If you use Python code in your question definitions, the code is executed
	first, and then the resulting CSV definition is used to create a question.
	It is sometimes useful to carefully check that the resulting CSV definition
	is what you intended; the CSV Preview window provides
	this functionality. If more than one question variation was generated, you can
	inspect each resulting CSV definition, using the navigation buttons.</p>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%;' src = 'images/csv.png'/>
	</p>

	<h3 id = '6.8'>6.8 Inspecting Python Namespaces</h3>
	<p>If you use Python code in your question definitions, you can inspect the values
	of local/global variables used in your code. This may be useful when debugging
	code. To this end, BSEditor provides a Python Namespace visualiser.
	It also allows for the namespaces to be erased.</p>
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%;' src = 'images/ns.png'/>
	</p>

	<h3 id = '6.9'>6.9 Export/Clear Log</h3>
	<p>Exporting the log is a feature existing mostly for application debugging
	purposes, whereas clearing the log can be used mainly for data privacy reasons.
	Both the Export and Clear options are accessible through the
	Tools menu, or by using the corresponding shortcut buttons.</p>

	<h3 id = '6.10'>6.10 Settings</h3>
	<p>You can configure many aspects of the application using the settings window.
	These settings are groupped into three main sections (tabs):</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>General</b><br/>
		This section allows you to specify alternative locations for the cache and log
		files used by BSGenerator, and also configure how those two files are used:<br/>
		<ul>
			<li>Cache<br/>
			The cache file contains metadata and previews of all files opened with
			BSGenerator/BSEditor.  You can monitor how much information/space it uses,
			set a maximum size for it, optimise it (remove files/folders that no longer exist),
			and choose whether BSEditor can work in tandem with BSGenerator to update the cache.
			</li>
			<li>Event Log<br/>
			As specified, the <a href = '0500BSEditor.html#5.3'>Event Log</a> helps keep track
			of all operations done with BSGenerator/BSEditor. You can monitor its size, set a
			maximum number of events log, and resize it.
			</li>
		<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
			<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%;' src = 'images/settings_general.png'/>
		</p>
		</ul>
		<li><b>Python</b><br/>
		This section lets you specify whether you want to use a specific Python interpreter
		or the one supplied with BSEditor, specify a timeout for Python compilations, and
		specify the maximum number of threads to use for parallel compilations.
		<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
			<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%;' src = 'images/settings_python.png'/>
		</p>
		<li><b>Display</b><br/>
		This section allows setting font sizes for all text windows, whether to use
		syntax highlighting in the question editor, and a zoom factor for the question
		preview display.
		<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
			<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:75%;' src = 'images/settings_display.png'/>
		</p>
	</ul>

	<h3 id = '6.11'>6.11 Help</h3>
	<p>BSGenerator contains extensive documentation (the pages you are now reading).
	These are available directly from both BSGenerator and BSEditor.</p>

	<h3 id = '6.12'>6.12 Quit</h3>
	<p>The Quit option closes the BSEditor window, and either returns to BSGenerator
	(if BSEditor was launched from within it) or quits the application.</p>
