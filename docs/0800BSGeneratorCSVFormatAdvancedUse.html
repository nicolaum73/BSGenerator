	<h2>8. BSGenerator CSV Format Advanced Use</h2>
	<p>The use of BSGenerator generally allows more control over what happens
	in the background with questions in Brightspace. However, given that the
	questions are edited offline, some care needs to be taken, particularly in what concerns the
	inclusion of files with questions (images and/or data files). Also, a
	basic understanding of how Python code is executed within BSGenerator will
	help in creating more complex questions. Finally, the lack of a WYSIWYG
	editor requires some basic HTML knowledge, and the inclusion of equations
	needs to be done in a different way.<br/>
	All these aspects are covered in this section.
