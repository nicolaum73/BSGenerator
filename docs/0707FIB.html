	<h3>7.7 Fill-in-the-Blanks Questions (FIB)</h3>
	<p>Fill-in-the-Blanks questions essentially represent the same kind of
	question as SA questions with multiple blanks. However, while the
	latter call each of the blanks "Blank # 1","Blank # 2", etc,
	FIB questions allow you to insert the blanks within the text of the
	question. They also allow partial correctness for each response
	(although they do not have the choice of scoring alternatives as
	SA questions with multiple blanks do).</p>


	<p>The following is a simple example of a CSV file containing the definition
	of a Fill-in-the-Blanks question:</p>
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/fib_2_Complete.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>The fields that can be specified are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<th>Field</th><th>Mandatory</th><th>Description</th>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>questiontype</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>Must be the first specified field. It states the type of the question.
			"FIB", "Fill in the Blanks", or "Fill-in-the-Blanks" are all accepted.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>title</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The title of the question.
			Defaults to "questiontitle".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>weighting</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The score of the question, between 0 and 9999. Defaults to 1.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>difficulty</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The difficulty of the question (1-5).
			Defaults to 1.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>isbonus</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>If this is a bonus question (yes) or not (no). Default no "no".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>ismandatory</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>If this is a mandatory question (yes) or not (no). Default no "yes".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>text</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>The text of the question. Must be contained within
			double quotes, if extending more than one line, or if containing commas.
			Can include HTML formatting. Contrary to all other question types, there
			can be several text definitions, interspersed with blank definitions.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>image</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Insert an image at the start of the question.
			Specifies a single field, which is the image location.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>blank</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>Defines a blank for the student to enter a response; at least one
			must be defined. Can be placed before, in the middle, or after
			other text and blank definitions. Blanks are automatically labelled 1, 2, etc.
			Can be specified with a number of columns (e.g. <i>blank,10</i>) or without
			(<i>blank,</i>), in which case its dimensions default to 30x1.
			Note that Brightspace only directly suports blanks with 5-30 columns
			(in multiples of 5), and a single line.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>response</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>A correct (or partially correct) answer, assigned to
			a blank. If there are blanks without responses assigned to them,
			the question must be corrected manually.</br>
			It specifies the score first (percentage of question points this
			response is worth), followed by the response, the type of
			response specified, and an optional label of the blank it refers to
			(defaults to 1, i.e. the first blank).<br/>
			The type can be:
			<ul>
				<li>"case": the response is case-sensitive;</li>
				<li>"nocase": the response is not case-sensitive;</li>
				<li>"regex": the response is a regular expression.</li>
			</ul>
			There is no limit to the number of responses given per blank.
			If more than one response matches the given answer, the
			first one declared is used.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>hint</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>A hint shown to the students when answering the
			question in a quiz. Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>feedback</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Feedback to show to the students, when
			visualising their test and answers after taking the test (it is
			not shown during test taking). Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>keyword</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Defines a keyword. Can have an optional second
			field with a value. These are not uploaded to Brightspace.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>keywords</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Same as before, but several keywords can be
			defined. No value will be associated with each keyword.</td>
		</tr>
