	<h2>2. Installation</h2>
	<h3 id = '2.1'>2.1 MacOS</h3>
	After downloading the DMG file, double-click it to mount the volume. It
	contains a PKG file (the installer), and a quick start PDF document.
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:50%;' src = 'images/mac_dmg.png'/>
	</p>
	Double-click the pkg file, and go through a standard MacOS installation
	procedure; you may need to type the system's password to proceed (this is
	so that the software can be installed in your Applications folder). Once
	the installation is complete, you can choose to remove the installer from
	your machine.
	<h3 id = '2.2'>2.2 Windows</h3>
	Windows software certification is pending. For now, you can download the
    Windows installer from the BSGenerator website. If using Edge, you may need to
    allow the download to proceed: press the <i>...</i> button in the top right
    corner, and choose ``Keep'':
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:50%;' src = 'images/win_dl1.png'/>
	</p>
    You may need to again confirm the download. Press <i>Show more</i> and then
    <i>Keep anyway</i>:
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:33%;' src = 'images/win_dl2.png'/>
	</p>
    Open the downloaded file to start the installer. Depending on your security
    settings, you may need to again confirm the installation. Then follow the
    installation process (for better results, stick to default choices).
	<h3 id = '2.3'>2.3 Uninstall</h3>
	BSGenerator does not provide a specific uninstall, so you can use the standard
	uninstalling procedure for your operating system:
	<ul>
		<li> For Windows, go to the main Windows "Settings" application, then choose
		"Apps", "Apps &amp; features"; then click the triple verticals dots next to
		BSGenerator, and choose "Uninstall".</li>
		<li>For MacOS, head over to "Applications", and just drag the BSGenerator icon
		to the recycle bin.</li>
	</ul>
