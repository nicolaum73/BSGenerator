	<h2>2. Installation</h2>
	As a registered developer license has not been acquired yet, both MacOS and
	Windows installation procedures are somewhat complex.
	<h3 id = '2.1'>2.1 MacOS</h3>
	After downloading the DMG file, double-click it to mount the volume. It
	contains a PKG file (the installer), and a quick start PDF document.
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:50%;' src = 'images/mac_dmg.png'/>
	</p>
	Double-click the pkg file, and go through a standard MacOS installation
	procedure; you may need to type the system's password to proceed (this is
	so that the software can be installed in your Applications folder). Once
	the installation is complete, you can choose to remove the installer from
	your machine.
	<h3 id = '2.2'>2.2 Windows</h3>
	Just as with MacOS, installation on a Windows system requires a few steps
	to bypass security. When downloading the EXE file, browsers such as
	Microsoft Edge may complain; you will have to confirm your intent to keep
	the file:
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:30%;' src = 'images/win1.png'/>
	</p>
	Once you do this, Microsoft Defender will likely trigger a final security
	check; you have to choose "Show More" and then "Keep Anyway":
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:30%;' src = 'images/win2.png'/>
	</p>
	Finally, once you double-click the installer file to execute it, Microsoft
	Defender might still complain; as before, press "More Info" and then "Run Anyway".
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:30%;' src = 'images/win3.png'/>
	</p>
	Once you are finally able to execute the file, the installation process can
	begin:
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:30%;' src = 'images/win4.png'/>
	</p>
	As with the Mac version, the installer goes through a typical Windows
	installation process; for better results, try to stick to the default
	choices. Once the installation is finished, you will find a "BSGenerator"
	folder in your Start Menu, with the executable "BSGenerator" inside it.
	<h3 id = '2.3'>2.3 Uninstall</h3>
	BSGenerator does not provide a specific uninstall, so you can use the standard
	uninstalling procedure for your operating system:
	<ul>
		<li> For Windows, go to the main Windows "Settings" application, then choose
		"Apps", "Apps &amp; features"; then click the triple verticals dots next to
		BSGenerator, and choose "Uninstall".</li>
		<li>For MacOS, head over to "Applications", and just drag the BSGenerator icon
		to the recycle bin.</li>
	</ul>
	</body>
