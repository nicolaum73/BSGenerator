	<h2>2. Installation</h2>
	Both the MacOS and the Windows versions are certified, so installation should
	be straightforward.
	<h3 id = '2.1'>2.1 MacOS</h3>
	After downloading the DMG file, double-click it to mount the volume. It
	contains a PKG file (the installer), and a quick start PDF document.
	<p style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<img style = 'display: inline-block; width:50%;' src = 'images/mac_dmg.png'/>
	</p>
	Double-click the pkg file, and go through a standard MacOS installation
	procedure; you may need to type the system's password to proceed (this is
	so that the software can be installed in your Applications folder). Once
	the installation is complete, you can choose to remove the installer from
	your machine.
	<h3 id = '2.2'>2.2 Windows</h3>
	BSEditor v2.0 and later are provided through the Microsoft Store. To install
	it, open the Microsoft Store app on your computer, search for BSEditor, and
	choose Get. As with the Mac version, the installer goes through a typical
	Windows installation process; for better results, try to stick to the default
	choices. Once the installation is finished, you will find a "BSGenerator"
	folder in your Start Menu, with the executable "BSEditor" inside it.
	<h3 id = '2.3'>2.3 Uninstall</h3>
	BSGenerator does not provide a specific uninstall, so you can use the standard
	uninstalling procedure for your operating system:
	<ul>
		<li> For Windows, go to the main Windows "Settings" application, then choose
		"Apps", "Apps &amp; features"; then click the triple verticals dots next to
		BSGenerator, and choose "Uninstall".</li>
		<li>For MacOS, head over to "Applications", and just drag the BSGenerator icon
		to the recycle bin.</li>
	</ul>
