	<h3>8.2 Use of Python Code</h3>
	<p>The input CSV files can contain Python code, which is executed prior to parsing
	the CSV fields. This allows the generation of several variations of the question,
	which will all be included in the single zip package.</p>

	<h4 id = '8.2.1'>8.2.1 Main Procedure</h4>
	To understand how to incorporate Python code in your questions, take the
	following CSV file, showing an MC question containing Python code:</p>
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/mc_4_All_of_the_above.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>Python code must always be contained within "%%" tokens. Before the file is
	parsed as a CSV file, the Python code is executed, and the output of the
	code between the %% tokens (if any) is appended onto the CSV specification.</p>

	<p>The example given generates a question that asks for either an example of
	quantitative data, or of qualitative data. It starts by importing the Python
	package <i>random</i>. Then it declares two lists, of quantitative and
	qualitative data examples, and a third list <i>a</i> (for answer), which
	contains a random quantitative example followed by a random qualitative
	example. Finally, it declares the two possible questions in the list <i>q</i>
	(ask for "quantitative" or "qualitative" example), and a random variable
	to choose it.</p>

	<p>In the question text, it inserts the chosen random question (the type of data
	from which to ask for an example). Finally, in the responses, it inserts either
	100 or 0 as a score, depending on the question asked, for each of the chosen
	random data examples. Since "shuffle,no" was specified, we can set the
	third and fourth responses as (all of the above)" and "(none of the above)".</p>

	To generate several versions of this question, set the required <b>Number of
	question variations</b> in the <a href = '0500BSEditor.html#5.4'>Button Toolbar</a>,
	and then press the <b>Preview</b> button.

	<h4 id = '8.2.2'>8.2.2 Implementation Details</h4>

	<p style = 'text-decoration: underline;'>Including Values in Question</p>

	<p>The execution of Python code works by attempting first to pass each full
	sequence of code (text between "%%" tokens) to <i>eval()</i> (which
	evaluates code and returns its value), and if that fails, then pass it to
	<i>exec()</i> (which executes code, but does not return anything). This
	means that the following code will not do what it seems:</p>

	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
	<p><textarea readonly rows = 10 style = 'width:75%;'>
%%s = True%%
response,100,%%if s:
  'Green'
else:
  'Blue'%%</textarea></p>
	</div>

	<p>Full if-statements will make <i>eval()</i> fail, so
	the if-statement will be passed to <i>exec()</i>, which does not
	return anything. This means that the CSV field would become
	"response,100,", which is an incomplete CSV field definition.</p>

	<p>To solve this, you can declare a function to execute the required logic,
	returning the value to be incorporated, and use the function call to insert
	the value, as in:</p>

	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
	<p><textarea readonly rows = 10 style = 'width:75%;'>
%%def colour(s):
  if s:
    return 'Green'
  else:
    return 'Blue'%%
%%s = True%%
response,100,%%colour(s)%%</textarea></p>
	</div>

	<p>Even better, if the logic to execute is fairly simple, use a one-line segment
	that returns a value (such as one-line if-statements, list comprehensions,
	etc):</p>

	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
	<p><textarea readonly rows = 10 style = 'width:75%;'>
%%s = True%%
response,100,%%'Green' if s else 'Blue'%%</textarea></p>
	</div>

	<p>Finally, you can use the <i>print()</i> function to print statements to the
	log, when compiling a question; this is useful for debugging proposes. But
	<b>do not use the <i>print()</i> function to try to incorporate text into
	the question; it will merely print it to the log.</b>

	<h4 id = '8.2.3'>8.2.3 Variable Scope</h4>

	<p>Variables used within Python code in questions exist only during the
	compilation phase of the question, and are immediately deleted afterwards.
	In some cases though, it might be interesting to share variable values between
	different executions (or "question runs").</p>

	<p>One such example is to use a variable that sequentially increases its value,
	for each question variation generated. This can be done by declaring variables
	global, and checking if they have already been declared, as shown below;
	the first question variation will ask for the name of the number 1, then
	the number 2, etc.</p>
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/wr_4_Global_Variable.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p><b>Use the <i>globals()</i> trick with caution. Global variables will
	remain in memory for subsequent runs of this question. Use the
	<a href = '0600BSEditorMainFunctions.html#6.8'>Python Namespaces</a> visualiser
	to reset local and global variables.</b>

	<h4 id = '8.2.4'>8.2.4 Choosing Python interpreter</h4>

	<p>BSGenerator can run your own Python code directly, which means that you
	do not need to install Python in your system to use the functionality of
	generating question variations.</p>

	<p>However, in some cases, you may want to use a Python library not included with
	the BSGenerator distribution (e.g. <i>Numpy</i> or <i>Pandas</i>). If you wish to use your
	own system's Python interpreter (and its libraries), then choose to do so in
	the application's <a href = '0600BSEditorMainFunctions.html#6.10'>Settings</a>.

	<b>Note that using the BSGenerator built-in Python interpreter can slow things down.
	Always try to use your own system Python, before using the built-in interpreter.</b>

	<p style = 'text-decoration: underline;'>Endless Python Loop</p>

	<p>You are free to include whichever Python code you want, in your CSV definitions.
	It might happen, under certain conditions, that your code will never terminate,
	such as in the following example; this effectively locks the application,
	not allowing you to do anything else.

	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
	<p><textarea readonly rows = 10 style = 'width:75%;'>
%%while True:
  continue
%%
questiontype,tf
text,Is this statement true or false?
true,100
false,0</textarea></p>
	</div>

	In order to avoid this, there are two possibilities. One is to use the
	<a href = '0600BSEditorMainFunctions.html#6.10'>setting</a> that automatically
	cancels Python code execution after a given amount of time. Another is to
	manually cancel the code execution; to do so, a small cross appears in the
	top right corner of the log window, allowing you to cancel the Python
	execution whenever it is active.
