	<h2>1. Overview</h2>
	The objective of BSGenerator is to allow instructors to create and maintain
	a library of questions offline, prior to using them in Virtual Learning Environments
	(VLEs) such as Brightspace. Questions are specified using an extended
	CSV-syntax, which can be enriched with Python code.
	Once a question (or a set of questions) has been created,
	BSGenerator can create QTI packages, which can be used to upload questions
	to the VLE's Question Library, or indeed upload quizzes created offline to the VLE.</br>
	Similarly, questions and quizzes created in Brightspace and exported as QTI packages
	can be imported into BSGenerator.

	</p>
	BSGenerator is a software bundle currently composed of two tools:
	BSEditor (previously known as BSInter) and BSManager. BSEditor is
	responsible for creating and testing CSV question specifications, whereas the main
	task of BSManager is Digital Asset Management (DAM). Think of them as a duo akin to
	Adobe Lightroom vs. Adobe Photoshop: Lightroom is used to maintain your collection of
	photos (with minimal editing), whereas Photoshop is used for artistic creation,
	single-photo edits, etc. Like Lightroom/Photoshop, there is some overlap between
	BSManager and BSEditor:
	<p>BSManager:
		<ul>
			<li>Inspect CSV questions and QTI packages;</li>
			<li>Create/edit metadata;</li>
			<li>Export sets of questions as QTI packages;</li>
			<li>Create quizzes;</li>
			<li>Inspect analytics related to CSV/QTI packages.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>BSEditor:
		<ul>
			<li>Create CSV question specifications;</li>
			<li>Visualise/test questions;</li>
			<li>Export CSV questions as QTI packages;</li>
			<li>Import CSV questions from QTI packages;</li>
			<li>Create/edit question metadata.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3 id = '1.2'>1.2 Brightspace</h3>
	Brightspace is a VLE that facilitates the distribution of learning content,
	management of assessment elements, etc. It provides the means to maintain a question
	library, which allows the import and export of questions to include in quizzes.
	It is (at the moment) the only VLE that BSGenerator is compatible with.
	</p>
	<h4 id = '1.2.1'>1.2.1 Quizzes</h4>
	<p>
		Quizzes in Brightspace are composed of one or more questions, of the
		following question types:
		<ul>
			<li><b><a href = '0701TF.html'>True/False (T/F)</a></b>:<br/>
			Like a multiple choice question, but with only two options, "True" and
			"False".</li>
			<li><b><a href = '0702MC.html'>Multiple-Choice (MC)</a></b>:<br/>
			A typical multiple-choice question, allowing from 1 to many choices,
			partially-correct choices, enumeration of choices, feedback per choice,
			etc.</li>
			<li><b><a href = '0703MS.html'>Multi-Select (MS)</a></b>:<br/>
			Allows the students to select one or more correct options, or a
			fixed number of options.</li>
			<li><b><a href = '0704WR.html'>Written Response (WR)</a></b>:<br/>
			Expects a phrase, paragraph or short essay as an answer; it is the only
			question type that cannot be automatically corrected. </li>
			<li><b><a href = '0705SA.html'>Short Answer (SA)</a></b>:<br/>
			Expects one or more short textual and/or numerical answers, by presenting
			blank text input boxes at the end of the question. If more than one answer
			are expected, it labels them as "Blank #1", "Blank #2", etc.</li>
			<li><b><a href = '0706MSA.html'>Multi Short Answer (MSA)</a></b>:<br/>
			Similar to an SA question with multiple blanks, but the order of the
			answers does not matter, i.e. a set of possible answers is specified, and
			the student can put any of those answers in any of the blanks (which are
			unlabelled).</li>
			<li><b><a href = '0707FIB.html'>Fill-in-the-Blanks (FIB)</a></b>:<br/>
			Similar to the previous two, but the blanks do not appear all at the end
			of the question, i.e. it can mix text and blanks. Each blank expects a
			specific answer (or an answer from a set of possible answers).</li>
			<li><b><a href = '0708MAT.html'>Matching (MAT)</a></b>:<br/>
			Presents a list of questions, and a list of answers, and the student
			must match each question with a corresponding answer (several questions
			may have the same answer, and not all answers need to be used).</li>
			<li><b><a href = '0709ORD.html'>Ordering (ORD)</a></b>:<br/>
			Similar to MAT, but for each question item, an order (1, 2, 3...) must
			be chosen. The same order number may be picked for different items, and
			not all order numbers need to used.</li>
			<li><b>Arithmetic (2+2)</b>:
			Expects a numeric answer from the student. The lecturer can specify some
			variables, which will allow for different numerical answers to be
			expected from each student. <i>(format not supported by BSGenerator)</i></li>
			<li><b>Significant Figures (x10)</b>:<br/>
			Somewhat similar to 2+2 questions, but works with values in scientific
			format (and expects answers in that format as well). <i>(format not
			supported by BSGenerator)</i></li>
			<li><b><a href = '0710LIK.html'>Likert (LIK)</a></b>:<br/>
			Queries the studen's opinion regarding a statement. The student should
			pick an item for a likert scale, such as a numeric score, agreement
			strenght, frequency, etc. Typically only used for surveys, not quizzes.</li>
		</ul>
		Brightspace allows users to either create questions through its web
		interface, or to upload pre-made questions. For the latter, there are two
		possible formats: CSV files, and IMS QTI compliant Course Packages.
	</p>
	<h4 id = '1.2.2'>1.2.2 CSV Format</h4>
	<p>
		The CSV format accepted by Brightspace is somewhat limited. It is restricted to
		T/F, MC, M+S, WR, SA, MAT, and ORD question types. It also restricts the
		question to simple text format (i.e. without formatting), allows no file or
		image attachments, and has several other limitations, such as (crucially)
		setting options such as randomisation of the possible answers on T+F and MC
		question type, etc. It does allow uploading several questions within a single
		CSV file, although these will all be uploaded to the root of the Question
		Library (or onto whichever section has been created and navigated into).
	</p>
	<h4 id = '1.2.3'>1.2.3 QTI Format</h4>
	<p>
		This is a format specified by the IMS Global Learning Consortium, which
		defines a format to specify assessment content and results that can then be
		exchanged between systems. It is mainly used for question design exchange
		between systems, although its design allows for exchange of other elements,
		such as tests, results, etc. Several learning tools are certified QTI
		Compliant, most notably Brightspace (Desire2Learn), Blackboard, and Moodle.
		There are several versions of the format, and different tools are certified for
		different versions.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is a very powerful format, but not straightforward to use. It consists of
		a zip package, which contains a manifest and a question database, along with
		potentially other supporting documents.
		The format used by Brightspace is a QTI format enriched with several
		extensions. The zip package contains the following files:
		<ul>
			<li>imsmanifest.xml: This is a short XML file, whose role seems to be
			solely to describe the type of the package. Regardless of the number and type
			of questions (and other files) to upload, this file seems to always be
			identical.</li>
			<li>questiondb.xml: This is a fairly complex XML file, which defines
			the question(s) and/or section(s) to upload.
			</li>
			<li>Other files: other files might be included, such as images that may
			be referenced from the text of the questions, or indeed folders containing
			those images. Any such files included in the zip package will be made available
			in Brightspace in the usual way, and can hence be referenced/linked to from the
			question(s) text.</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The following figure shows the Brightspace import option to upload a
		question; it can be found under “Assessment / Quizzes / Question Library”.
