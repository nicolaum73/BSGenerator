	<h3>8.1 Inclusion of Files/Images</h3>
	<p>The "text" field of questions, when written in HTML, can make reference to
	images and/or support files. For example, the following CSV file shows an SA
	question, linking to a datafile, and also including an image:</p>
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/sa_5_Include_Files.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>Files linked from the HTML code will be automatically included in the zip
	archive, and thus uploaded to Brightspace; they will be located in the root
	folder of the module, unless specified otherwise (see
	<a href = '0600BSEditorMainFunctions.html#6.4'>Exporting QTI Packages</a>).
	This is the case with <i>example_data.xlsx</i> and <i>example_image.png</i>, above.</p>

	<p>If relative folders are specified, such as in <i>data/example_excel.xlsx</i>,
	then a folder named "data" is created in Brightspace (if it is not already
	present), and the files will be uploaded into that folder.</p>

	<p>Note that uploading files <b>will</b> overwrite files with the same name
	in Brightspace. However, if a folder with the same name already exists, then it
	is not overwritten, and files already inside it in Brightspace are kept (unless
	new versions with the same name are included in the zip archive). More
	details on how images/attachments are handled are given <a href = '0600BSEditorMainFunctions.html#6.10'>here</a>.</p>

	<p>An example of good practice is to place files specific to a question in
	their own folder (e.g. "correlation_question/example_data.xlsx"), to avoid
	accidentally replacing files with the same name from other questions. This
	practice will also help the deletion of support files related to a specific
	question: just delete the related folder (e.g. "correlation_question").
	In Brightspace, this can be reached through "Module Tools" / "Module Admin" /
	"Manage Files" (deleting questions in Brightspace does not delete corresponding
	referenced files).</p>

	<p>Note that any fields accepting HTML code ("text", "feedback", "response",
	"answerkey", etc) will have their links processed this way, and can be used
	to include files in the zip archive for later upload to Brightspace.</p>

	<p>Finally, make sure that any HTML web links used open in a new window/tab, by
	using <i>target='_blank'</i>.</p>
