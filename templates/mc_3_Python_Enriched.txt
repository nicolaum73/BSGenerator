# Python code can be used inside questions, to create
# multiple variations of questions. To do so, surround
# it with %% on either side. You can do this in 2 ways:
# 1. Code execution, such as variable assignment,
#    creates no output. Example:
%%q = 'mc'%%
# 2. Code evaluation, such as variable names, inserts
#    the resulting value as a string into the question
#    definition. Example (to set questiontype to mc):
questiontype,%%q%%
# Standard Python modules are provided with BSGenerator.
# If you need a specific module, use your system's Python
# interpreter (choose this option in the settings).
%%import random%%
# In this example question, we define two lists, of correct
# and incorrect answers, fill them with as many elements as
# possible, and then shuffle them:
%%ok = []%%
%%ok.append('Correct answer 1.')%%
%%ok.append('Correct answer 2.')%%
%%ok.append('Correct answer 3.')%%
%%ok.append('Correct answer 4.')%%
%%ok.append('Correct answer 5.')%%
%%random.shuffle(ok)%%
%%ko = []%%
%%ko.append('Incorrect answer 1.')%%
%%ko.append('Incorrect answer 2.')%%
%%ko.append('Incorrect answer 3.')%%
%%ko.append('Incorrect answer 4.')%%
%%ko.append('Incorrect answer 5.')%%
%%random.shuffle(ko)%%
# Next we randomly choose what we are asking the student to
# choose (i.e. is the right choice an element of the correct
# or incorrect list?):
%%qtext = random.choice(['correct','incorrect'])%%
# If the right choice is an element of the incorrect list,
# swap the ok and ko lists:
%%if qtext == 'incorrect':
    ok, ko = ko, ok%%
# Finally, insert the chosen adjective in the question text.
