title,FIB example with regular expressions
text,"Technically speaking, a sidereal year has "
blank,5,1
text," days."
# Questions with blanks can have three kinds of specified
# correct answers: 'case' for case-sensitive equal answers,
# 'nocase' for case insensitive equal answers, and 'regex'
# for answers matched using a regular expression.
#
# Regular expressions can match any subexpression in the
# answer given, so you can use ^ to mark the start of the
# answer text, and $ to mark the end. Note that spaces at
# the start and end of regular expressions are always
# ignored by Brightspace.
