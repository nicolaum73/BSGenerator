	<h3>7.6 Multi Short Answer Questions (MSA)</h3>
	<p>MSA questions ask a question, and then request several possible answers to
	that question. They are different from SA questions with multiple blanks:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>SA questions with multiple blanks have one or more specific responses
		defined for each blank;</li>
		<li>MSA questions define a set of possible responses, which can be
		placed in any blank.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>In short, SA questions with multiple blanks are like <a href = '0707FIB.html'>FIB Questions</a>,
	whereas MSA questions are of the type "give <i>n</i> examples of ...". Also note that, unlike
	SA or FIB questions, MSA have native support for blanks with several rows (this may change in
	the future).</p>

	<p>The following is a simple example of a CSV file containing the definition
	of a Multi Short Answer question:</p>
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/msa_2_Complete.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>The fields that can be specified are as follows:</p>
	<table>

			the expected response, and then the type of answer specified.
			The type can be:
			<ul>
				<li>"case": the response is case-sensitive;</li>
				<li>"nocase": the response is not case-sensitive;</li>
				<li>"regex": the response is a regular expression.</li>
			</ul>
			There is no limit to the number of responses given per blank.
