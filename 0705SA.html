	<h3>7.5 Short Answer Questions (SA)</h3>
	<p>Short Answer questions ask for one or more short
	answers (textual or numeric). These are then compared to pre-defined
	answers, for each blank.</p>

	<p>In Brightspace, single blank short answer and multiple blank short answer
	questions are somewhat different, even though they both are defined
	under the same question type. Single blank present a single
	text-entry box for the user to type their answer; the score for that answer
	reflects the total score for the question. For multiple blank
	questions, there are different scoring options.</p>

	<p>Note that BSGenerator provides some extensions to the online-editor used
	by Brightspace, for single blank questions, in that not-fully-correct answers
	can be specified.</p>

	<p>Multiple blank short answers defined through SA questions seem somewhat of an
	after-thought in Brightspace, and are much better implemented either
	through <a href = '0706MSA.html'>Multi Short Answer</a> or
	<a href = '0707FIB.html'>Fill-in-the-Blanks</a> questions.</p>

	<p>The following is a simple example of a CSV file containing the definition
	of a Short Answer question:</p>
	<div style = 'text-align:center;'>
		<iframe style = 'display: inline-block; width:80%;'
		type="text/plain" src="../../templates/sa_2_Complete.txt"></iframe>
	</div>

	<p>The fields that can be specified are as follows:</p>
	<table>
		<tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<th>Field</th><th>Mandatory</th><th>Description</th>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>questiontype</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>Must be the first specified field. It states the type of the question.
			 "SA", "Short Answer", or "Short Answer Question" are all accepted.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>title</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The title of the question.
			Defaults to "questiontitle".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>weighting</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The score of the question, between 0 and 9999. Defaults to 1.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>difficulty</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The difficulty of the question (1-5).
			Defaults to 1.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>isbonus</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>If this is a bonus question (yes) or not (no). Default no "no".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>ismandatory</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>If this is a mandatory question (yes) or not (no). Default no "yes".</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>text</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>The text of the question. Must be contained within
			double quotes, if extending more than one line, or if containing commas.
			Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>score</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The scoring to use; defaults to "equal".
			Must be set before specifying blanks or responses. Can be set to:
			<ul>
				<li>"equal": the question points are equally distributed among all
				blanks (use this for single blank questions);</li>
				<li>"all": all-or-nothing, i.e. the student must correctly
				answer all the blanks to receive the full question marks.</li>
			</ul></td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>blanks</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>The number of blanks: 1 (default, for single blank)
			or more.<!-- Can be followed by number of columns and rows.--></td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>response</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> x </td>
			<td>A correct (or partially correct) answer. Must
			define at least one. It specifies the score first, followed by the expected
			response, and then the type of answer specified; an optional fourth field
			defines the blank this response refers to (defaults to 1, i.e. the first blank).</br>
			For single blank questions, the score is a percentage of the
			total question points. For multiple blank questions, if the score is set to
			"equal", then the response score must be set to <i>1/n</i> for <i>n</i> blanks
			(e.g. 0.5 for two blanks); if the score is set to "all", then the
			response scores must all be set to "0". The type can be:
			<ul>
				<li>"case": the response is case-sensitive;</li>
				<li>"nocase": the response is not case-sensitive;</li>
				<li>"regex": the response is a regular expression.</li>
			</ul>
			There is no limit to the number of responses given per blank.
			If more than one response matches the given answer, the
			first one declared is used.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>hint</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>A hint shown to the students when answering the
			question in a quiz. Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>feedback</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Feedback to show to the students, when
			visualising their test and answers after taking the test (it is
			not shown during test taking). Can include HTML formatting.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>keyword</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Defines a keyword. Can have an optional second
			field with a value. These are not uploaded to Brightspace.</td>
		</tr><tr style = 'vertical-align: top;'>
			<td>keywords</td>
			<td style = 'text-align:center;'> </td>
			<td>Same as before, but several keywords can be
			defined. No value will be associated with each keyword.</td>
