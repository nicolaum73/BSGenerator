	<h2>7. BSGenerator CSV Format</h2>
	<p>A CSV file describing a question can have different fields, depending on the
	question type. This section describes the formats of CSV files for the
	question types supported by BSGenerator. Note that, when uploading
	questions to Brightspace, no existing questions will be overlapped, whether
	they were created there, or previously uploaded. BSGenerator can only be used
	to upload new questions, and it will never modify/overlap existing questions in
	the Brightspace; images and/or files used with questions may however overwrite
	existing ones in Brightspace (see <a href = '0600BSEditorMainFunctions.html#6.10'>Settings</a>).</p>

	<p>In other to maintain compatibility between Windows and Mac computers, a standard
	way to specify paths had to be chosen; the choice is to use forward slashes. So
	when specifying paths (e.g. for images in the question text), specify them such
	as <i>C:/Program Files/image name.jpg</i>.</p>

	<p>All field definitions can be contained within double quotes.
	If you need to use the double quote character in a field, then do not surround
	that definition with double quotes (e.g. using <i>text,"The Text"</i> will
	generate the question text as <b>The Text</b>, whereas <i>text,The "Text"</i>
	will generate <b>The "Text"</b>).

	<p>Note that Brightspace updates their formats quite regularly, so some
	functionality provided by the application may not work in the future.
	For example, Brightspace allows the insertion of an image at the start of some
	question types; this is replicated by the <i>image</i> field.
	However, this functionality is limited (images are always shown at the start of
	the question, and in their maximum size). Brightspace seems to be slowly
	removing this, in favour of simply inserting images with HTML code within the
	text of questions.</p>
