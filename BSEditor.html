            <p class = 'small_txt left'>BSEditor is the main question creation tool of BSGenerator. It provides a powerful editor to easily control every detail of a question, from integration of files and images, to elaborate scoring approaches.</p>
            <p class = 'small_txt left'>Being a native computer application (Mac and Windows), you can use it everywhere, with or without internet connectivity, and easily access all assets from your local machine.</p>

            <p class = 'big_txt right'>Python integration for unlimited potential</p>
            <p class = 'small_txt right'>BSEditor integrates a full Python distribution, or you can use your own environment and libraries. This provides you with the power to create on-the-fly datasets, images, plots, regular expressions, etc.</p>
            <p class = 'small_txt right'>The ability to compile a question several times is deeply integrated into the software. This means that you can easily create variations of questions, improving both integrity during exams, and reuse of questions in several tests.</p>

            <p class = 'big_txt left'>Format independence</p>
            <p class = 'small_txt left'>Although the format of questions used by BSEditor is unique, it can easily be converted to several other formats, including the highly accepted QTI open format. This means that you will never be stuck with a unique format for your educational material.</p>
            <p class = 'small_txt left'>This flexibility with formats allows you to store your questions locally in your device, in a web-based drive, in the online Evaluation Tool of your choice, or indeed in all three at the same time.</p>
